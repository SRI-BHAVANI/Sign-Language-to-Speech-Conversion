# Sign-Language-to-Speech-Conversion

In this project sign language is converted to speech using Faster RCNN Resnet to train the model, that classifies the input image and the generated text(class label) is converted to speech using win32com.client with Dispatch method. <br>
The complete procedure followed to build the model for this project can be found in this [tutorial](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
